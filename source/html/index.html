			<h3> About the Developers </h3>
		</section>

		<section id="p-frontpage">
			<p > A software development team at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University
				in Daytona Beach is designing a web-based tool with which a user can input
				research papers, view graphs of the citations, and add necessary info.
				The system will accept research papers that contain references in the LaTex/BibTex format
				in order to output a visual dependency graph that shows the dependencies between the paper and its references.
				The purpose of the project is to create a tool which a user can use to see the dependencies between a paper and its references.
				The user will be able to view the dependencies between the papers and will be able to add to and modify information about the papers
