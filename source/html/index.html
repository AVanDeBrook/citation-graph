        <h3> About the Developers </h3>
        <p> A software development team at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach is designing a web-based tool with which a user can input research papers, view graphs of the citations, and add necessary info. The system will accept research papers that contain references in the LaTex/BibTex format in order to output a visual dependency graph that shows the dependencies between the paper and its references. The purpose of the project is to create a tool which a user can use to see the dependencies between a paper and its references. The user will be able to view the dependencies between the papers and will be able to add to and modify information about the papers
