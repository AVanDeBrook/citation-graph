\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.

\param Abstract Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be usedto support high data rate transmissions over time-dispersive fadingchannels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-basedtransmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detectionof the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response(FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations ofthe OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersivechannels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannotbe used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately,many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devisingchannel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channelmodel. While the channel estimation results from these algorithmscan be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly beapplied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detailthe reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one forthe OFDM-based communication systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usageof this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper alsopresents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communicationsystems, which can be used to access the channel parameterestimation algorithmsrealistically.
