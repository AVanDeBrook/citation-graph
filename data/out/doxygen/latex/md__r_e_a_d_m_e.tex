ERAU DB EECS Senior Design Project. Generates the citation graph of research papers.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Application background}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
When researchers do research, they read a lot of papers. It is really a good idea to be able to how one paper is dependent on a couple of other papers. That is why they have to have a list of references at the end of the paper. When they want to track the dependencies of the papers, using the paper-\/based or pdf-\/based approach is awkward. There are some tools currently on the market to display the citation/dependency graphs of the papers. They are usually web-\/based, which is good for navigation.

However, the current produces lack an important function\+: adding necessary info to the citation graph. This info includes the summary of important contributions of the paper, how each contribution is related to a specific citation, the names of authors, the affiliation of the authors at the time of publishing the paper (which means there can be a list of affiliations for a single author). It is our contribution to implement the dependency/citation graph with the added information.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Cloning, Building, etc.}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
To clone\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone https://github.com/AVanDeBrook/citation-\/graph.git}

\end{DoxyCode}
 To build\+: The following dependencies are needed\+:

Python v3.\+x Dependencies\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily bibtexparser}
\item {\ttfamily re} (if not provided by default w/ python 3.\+x)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Use the following script to download the dependencies listed above 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{pip install bibtexparser re}

\end{DoxyCode}


Non-\/\+Python Dependencies\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html}{\texttt{ Doxygen}} \href{https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen}{\texttt{ (Git\+Hub,}} \href{https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E88353_01/html/E37839/doxygen-1.html}{\texttt{ man pages)}}
