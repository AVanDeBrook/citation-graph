<section id="p-aboutpage">
    <p> A software development team at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University
        in Daytona Beach is designing a web-based tool with which a user can input
        research papers, view graphs of the citations, and add necessary info.
        The system will accept research papers that contain references in the LaTex/BibTex format
        in order to output a visual dependency graph that shows the dependencies between the paper and its
        references.
        The purpose of the project is to create a tool which a user can use to see the dependencies between a paper
        and its references.
        The user will be able to view the dependencies between the papers and will be able to add to and modify
        information about the papers
