# Citation Graph
ERAU DB EECS Senior Design Project.

**Application background:** When researchers do research, they read a lot of papers. It is really a good idea to be able to how one paper is dependent on a couple of other papers. That is why they have to have a list of references at the end of the paper. When they want to track the dependencies of the papers, using the paper-based or pdf-based approach is awkward. There are some tools currently on the market to display the citation/dependency graphs of the papers. They are usually web-based, which is good for navigation.

However, the current produces lack an important function: adding necessary info to the citation graph. This info includes the summary of important contributions of the paper, how each contribution is related to a specific citation, the names of authors, the affiliation of the authors at the time of publishing the paper (which means there can be a list of affiliations for a single author). It is our contribution to implement the dependency/citation graph with the added information.
